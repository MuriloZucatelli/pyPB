# General
This code is part of a master's degree work developed at the Universidade Federal do Esp√≠rito Santo, at the Oil and Gas Flow and Measurement Center (NEMOG). 
Its objective is to solve the population balance equations to predict the development of the droplet size distribution in an emulsion

# Python support for PBM
   
This is a collection of Python modules for routine population balance equation calculation 

 * Method of classes using constant mesh grid (Hidy and Brock 1970)
 * Method of classes using geometric mesh grid (Kumar and Ramkrishna 1996)
 * Method os moments (under construction)

## Population balance modelling
This code includes a series of:
   * Breakup models
   * Coalescence models
   * Droplet distribution models at breakage
   * Initial droplet distribution models
   * Multiparametric numerical optimization routines
   * Multiobjective numerical optimization routines
   * Modules for post-processing results
