# Python support for CFD
   
This is a collection of Python modules for routine CFD calculation 

 * Colebrook-White friction factor check with single phase pipe
 * Calculation of turbulence intensities for inlet BC specification
 * Wheeler and PD moment inversion algorithms
 * Method of classes method

## General

### Pressure drop

Simple pressure drop calculation based on Colebrook-White. Tested with efunda calculator.

## Turbulence

### Turbulent BC

## Population balance modelling
### Methods of moments
#### Wheeler's moment inversion

Also known as Modified Chebyshev algorithm (Gautschi 2004). Obtains a set of weights and abcissas from the set of moments.

#### Realizability check
Checks whether Hadamard matrices have non-negative determinants
